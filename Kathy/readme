Instructions – Running Modified EMIC Polarization Codes
3 September 2019
Environmental Setup 

Data Folder 
  Add a data folder (to home directory?)
    ~/data 
  This is also where rbsp files are automatically downloaded 
    ~/data/rbsp/emfisis/Flight/RBSP-B/L3/2014/05/09
  Download latest CDFLeapSeconds.txt file from 
      https://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/CDFLeapSeconds.txt
    and put in 
      ~/data/mis 

Running IDL

Commands
   idl – starts idl 
  .rnew filename.pro (or just .r filename.pro)  -- run 
  .c – continue after ‘stop’
  exit – exit IDL
  
  Hard Stop for IDL   -- Ctrl+\   -- use if exit doesn’t work 

Note: After aborting IDL by using Ctrl+\, you may find that your terminal is left in the wrong state. You can restore your terminal to the correct state by issuing one of the following UNIX commands
   % reset      or   % stty echo -cbreak
		Check to see if still running
			ps 
 			ps -u username


Anthony’s Polarization Code 
Modified Version
    polarization_analysis_KAD_09May14.pro
    
For Anthony's code polarization_analysis.pro, need to have the functions
  fft_spec.pro
  tdigital_filter.pro
  trotate_to_fac.pro

May also need... 
  thm_fac_matrix_make.pro

Need SPEDAS package
  http://spedas.org/
  http://spedas.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page


Run Commands 
  IDL
 .rnew polarization_analysis_KADfinal.pro

POLARIZATION_ANALYSIS
(at STOPS, type '.c' to get code to continue) 
exit (leave idl) 




May need to set ‘dot’ files in home directory… here are the commands in mine…
